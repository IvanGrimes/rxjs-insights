<h1 align="center">RxJS Insights</h1>

RxJS Insights is a toolset that helps you debug and visualize the observables in your app.

**âœ¨ Developer friendly**: Easy to set up. Easy to use.

**âœ¨ Unobtrusive**: Does not require source code modification.

**âœ¨ Comprehensive**: Tracks all types of events and relations.

The data gathered by the RxJS Insights includes the information about:

* **constructor** calls, including the arguments passed to it, the name of the Observable (sub)class, and the source code location of the call,
* **creation operator** calls, including the arguments passed to it, the name of the operator, and the source code location of the call,
* **pipeable operator** calls, including the arguments passed to it, the name of the operator, and the source code location of the call,
* **subscribers** (i.e. the instances of the running observables), including the relation to the parent observable, as well as relations to other subscribers that are either sources or destinations of the given subscriber,
* **callers** (i.e. the connection with the world outside the RxJS, e.g. direct `subscribe` calls from the application), including the arguments passed to it, and the source code location of the call,
* **events**, including the **notification events** (i.e. `next`, `error`, and `complete`) and **subscription events** (i.e. `subscribe` and `unsubscribe`), as well as relations to other events that either caused or are caused by the given event,
* **async tasks** within which the events happened (e.g. `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, DOM events, REST events, etc.).

## Future work

* ðŸ§© Create plugins for other bundlers (e.g. Rollup, Parcel, etc.), 
* ðŸ§© Add more visualization options (e.g. marble diagrams),
* ðŸ§© Allow for better customization.
